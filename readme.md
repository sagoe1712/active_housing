# Active Housing

This is my solution to the assessment test given by Active Housing

## Installation

First, you would clone the repo to your local system

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sagoe1712/active_housing.git
```

Next, you would install all dependencies used

```bash
composer install
```

## Usage
Make sure the project is appropriately configured on apache or docker environment

```python
# To run the PHP test, copy the command below
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

Project would be executed on the index.php page and it users autoloaders
